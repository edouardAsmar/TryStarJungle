# Henry Magun's application

## In order to test out what I've done:
 * Clone or download the repository (there is a button for this)
 * open your terminal
 * Type:
 ```
 	cd [pathtodownload]/trystarjungle;
 	npm install;
 	sudo npm install -g nodemon;
 	nodemon webserver.js
 ```
 * point your browser to localhost:3000
 * enjoy (right now there's not much but there will be... soon)
